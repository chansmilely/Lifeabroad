<p>
The culture of Korea is <strong><u>the shared cultural and historical heritage of Korea</u> and southern Manchuria.</strong> As one of the oldest continuous cultures in the world, Koreans have passed down their traditional narratives in a variety of ways.
<p style="margin-top:20px;">
Since the mid-20th century, Korea has been split between the North and South Korean states, resulting today in a number of cultural differences. Before the Joseon Dynasty, the practice of Korean shamanism was deeply rooted in Korean culture.
